## Unit test 
Unit testing workflow involves defining a .yml file inside the .github/workflows. This file specifies steps, such as setting up the Python environment, installing dependencies, and running unit tests. Additionally, need to include environment variables, like MOCK_DATA, to enable specific behaviors, such as mocking data during tests. Overall, this workflow ensures that unit tests are automatically executed whenever there are code changes, promoting continuous integration and reliable code quality.
